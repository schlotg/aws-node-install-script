# aws-node-install-script
This is a script I use to get Node up and running on AWS Linux instances. To use this script create an Amazon Linux instance in your AWS console and then ssh into it. To launch the script type: 
```
  curl -L https://github.com/schlotg/aws-node-install-script/master/install | bash 
```
